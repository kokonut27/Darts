# **Darts! A simple and fun game!!**

Darts is a game I made a while ago, and at that time, it was just a fun project that I had made while learning Python. However, now, it seems like lots of people seem to like it, and so I decided to bring it to another level ;)

## **What's new!**
I introduced a *database* to this project. What the database does is that it acts as a leaderboard, and holds all the scores. As of right now, it is very easy to bot and hack, so I may need to fix that, or I might remove the database. I am also thinking about adding a start screen, with credits, and etc. (Thanks to @AtlantianNet for the idea!)

## **What's still there!**
The darts game has not been edited from last time as:

1. People seemed to enjoy the original darts, so I left it as it is.
2. I think it seems the best as it is original, plain and original :)

## **Conclusion**
I hope you enjoy this new version of darts! Expect new updates now and then from this ;) Byee!
